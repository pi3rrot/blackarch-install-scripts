        1. Install from Live-ISO.

        2. Install from BlackArch Official Repository.
            - It will install base system from Arch Linux and

            into your hard drive. You can choose the packages to install.
        3. Install from Blackman.
            - It will install base system from Arch Linux and
            will download and compile all the BlackArch Linux packages
            from their source according to PKGBULD files.
    3. Partitioning:
        3.1. Set the device you want to install BlackArch Linux in.
            -> i.e. /dev/sda (default one)
        3.2. Choose Partition Mode:
            * At the moment, only /boot and / root partition are supported.
            * We will add optional /home and Swap in future releases.
            1. Automatic - only empty HD! new partitions will be created in
               /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2.
                - This mode its thinking for Virtual Machines environment,
                where hard disk isnt contain any partitions already.
                It will create by default sda1 for /boot partition
                and sda2 for / root partition. Also, it will format
                /boot partition with ext2 type and / root partition with
                ext4 type.
                - The only configurable thing here its the size of both
                partitions. Set it by default to 100MB for /boot and
                10GB for / root partition.
                - WARNING: this mode isnt tested properly in non Virtual
                Machine box. So do not used it at least you know what
                you are doing. You had been warned bitch. ;)
            2. Manual - set manual partitions with cfdisk and format them.
                - This mode will run cfdisk utility for partition creation.
                Once you have set up your proper /boot and / root partition,
                dont forget to Write and you are good to go.
                It will ask you when Quit for the /boot and / root partition
                number chosed, also the partition type is required for
                format purposes.
    4. Install
